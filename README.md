      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This project aims to build a binary image classifier to distinguish between African and Asian Elephants using the VGG19 architecture. The VGG19 architecture is a deep convolutional neural network that has shown great success in many computer vision tasks. In this project, we will use transfer learning, where we will use the pre-trained VGG19 model and fine-tune it on a smaller dataset of African and Asian Elephants.</p>

      <h2>Dependencies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keras</li>
        <li>TensorFlow</li>
        <li>NumPy</li>
        <li>Matplotlib</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>The project can be run using the following command:</p>
      <p>The project uses the Kaggle African and Asian Elephant dataset, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivmankar/asian-vs-african-elephant-image-classification">here</a>.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning in building image classifiers with a small dataset. By fine-tuning the pre-trained VGG19 model, we were able to achieve a 59% accuracy in classifying African and Asian Elephants. The code can easily be adapted to other binary image classification problems with a small dataset.</p>
